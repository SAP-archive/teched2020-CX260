# Exercise 6 - Product Comparison Header

In this exercise, you will implement the header of comparison table. The header contains some
high-level product information, such as the main image, name and price.

## Exercise 6.1 Code scaffolding

Let's start generating the header component in it's own module:

```sh
ng g m product-comparison/comparison-header
ng g c product-comparison/comparison-header
```

We're going to use a number of Spartacus components in the header module, which is why we isolate the component in its own module. You should add the following modules to the generated `ComparisonHeaderModule`:

- `RouterModule` from `@angular/router`
- `UrlModule` from `@spartacus/core`
- `IconModule` and `MediaModule` from '@spartacus/storefront'

The modules export various components and directives that we leverage in the header component.

## Exercise 6.2 Implement component logic

We can now implement our component logic. We delegate most of the logic to the `ProductComparisonService`. The implementation of this service can be found [in the source](./src/product-comparison/services/product-comparison.service.ts), given that's a fair amount of code, we're not going over it line by line.

Let's leverage the `ProductComparisonService` in the new header component. We bring in the selected products to the header component and reuse the toggle method that we've added in exercise 3.1.

```ts
export class ComparisonHeaderComponent {
  constructor(private comparisonService: ProductComparisonService) {}

  products$ = this.comparisonService.getList([ProductScope.DETAILS])

  remove(code: string): void {
    this.comparisonService.toggle(code)
  }
}
```

## Exercise 6.3 Implement view logic

We're going to observe the list of selected products (`products$`) and render the product image, name and price. If there's no single product selected, we render an alternative text (templateRef `#empty`).

```html
<thead>
  <tr *ngIf="products$ | async as productList; else empty">
    <th></th>
    <th *ngFor="let product of productList">
      <button
        (click)="remove(product.code)"
        class="close"
        cxIcon="CLOSE"
      ></button>
      <a [routerLink]="{ cxRoute: 'product', params: product } | cxUrl">
        <cx-media [container]="product.images?.PRIMARY"></cx-media>
        <div>{{ product.name }}</div>
        <div>{{ product.price.formattedValue }}</div>
      </a>
    </th>
  </tr>
  <ng-template #empty>
    <tr>
      <td>No products to compare.</td>
    </tr>
  </ng-template>
</thead>
```

There might a few new gotchas for you with this implementation

- we're using the `cxIcon` directive to add an icon from [the icon library](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/icon-library/).
- we're using the `cxRoute` to ensure that the link to the product page is based on [configurable routing](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/configurable-routing/)
- we're using the `cx-media` component to render an (optimized image from the product)[https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/media-component/]

We're adding a few style rules to the scss file:

```scss
a {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

cx-media {
  width: 50%;
}
```

## Exercise 6.4 Add header

To import the header component we must do 2 things:

1. export the `ComparisonHeaderComponent` in the `ComparisonHeaderModule`

2. add the `app-comparison-header` to the html of the `ComparisonTableComponent`:

```html
<table>
  <app-comparison-header></app-comparison-header>
</table>
```

## Summary

Now that you've added the header to the `ComparisonTableComponent`, you should be able to see the selected products on the comparison page.
We will implement more comparison attributes in the next exercise.

ðŸ’¡ If you haven't done already, it's a good time again to commit your changes.
